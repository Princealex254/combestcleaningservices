- Activity logs can be deleted by admins
- Email credentials stored locally (not in database)

### Access Control
- Only authenticated admins can view logs
- Email configuration requires admin access
- Activity deletion requires confirmation

## Troubleshooting

### Email Not Sending
1. Check EmailJS configuration in admin panel
2. Verify EmailJS service is active
3. Check email template variables match
4. Test with "Test Email Service" button
5. Check browser console for errors

### Activities Not Logging
1. Check Firebase connection
2. Verify admin is logged in
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Ensure Firebase rules allow writing to 'activityLogs' collection

### Performance
- Logs are stored in Firebase with automatic indexing
- Email sending is asynchronous (won't slow down admin actions)
- Old logs can be manually deleted to maintain performance

## Firebase Rules Update
Add this rule to your Firebase Security Rules:

```javascript
// Allow authenticated users to read/write activity logs
match /activityLogs/{document} {
  allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
}
```
